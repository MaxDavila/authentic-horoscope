# Authentic Horoscope

Get your short and sweet no BS horoscope. 

I run your shitty daily horoscope through a basic sentiment analysis algorithm in order
to get a positive or negative score. I then use your fucking score to come up with a short and sweet no BS horoscope
that will tell you how wonderful or shitty your life really is.

I used a free [horoscope website](http://www.findyourfate.com/rss/horoscope-astrology-feed.asp?mode=view), 
because I wasn't about to pay for an API. 
Yes, I am parsing XML for you.
